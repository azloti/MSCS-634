# Lab Assignment: Classification Using KNN and RNN Algorithms


## Purpose
In this lab, I compared K-Nearest Neighbours and Radius Neighbours classifiers on the Wine dataset from scikit. I analyzed how different parameters affect classification accuracy.

## Insights

KNN proved to be more stable and accurate for this classification task. Fewer neighbors (lower k) worked best for KNN, while RNN had lowed performance at any radius.

## Challenges

Finding the right functions to use to both train the classifiers and plot the data took some time, and I am unsure if the values selected were the best.
