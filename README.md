# Lab Assignment: Data Visualization, Data Preprocessing, and Statistical Analysis Using Python

## Purpose
The purpose of this lab was to gain practical experience with data analysis and visualization techniques in Python and JupyterLab, using a real-life dataset.

## Key Insights
I developed a better understanding of how to use pandas and numpy to explore data, identify / remove outliers, and visualize the data through charts

## Challenges and Decisions
- Selecting a dataset that works well for all the requirements was a minor challenge
- I tried to avoid using external libraries as much as possible in order to get better insights specifically on panda / numpy, tutorials were sometimes difficult to find
